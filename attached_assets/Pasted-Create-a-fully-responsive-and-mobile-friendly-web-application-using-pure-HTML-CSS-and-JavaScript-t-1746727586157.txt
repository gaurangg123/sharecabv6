Create a fully responsive and mobile-friendly web application using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that functions as a clone of the website https://sharecab.vercel.app/. The design should follow a clean, modern, and intuitive layout that works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices. Ensure navigation is smooth and user experience is prioritized. The application must include a Home Page with visually appealing animated elements, specifically a custom animation showing a vehicle icon moving along a defined path from Point A to Point B, simulating a ride. Use SVG or CSS animations to achieve this motion path effect, giving a dynamic feel to the landing page. Implement full user authentication, including both Login and Sign-Up pages. These pages must support secure two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanisms. Incorporate OTP verification via email or mobile number, and also allow Microsoft Authenticator integration using time-based one-time passwords (TOTP). Additionally, add Google OAuth sign-in support so users can log in using their Google accounts for improved convenience. Include a consistent navigation bar or bottom tab layout for mobile, featuring the following main sections: Home: Contains the animated route, introduction text, and call-to-action. Book a Ride: A form-based page where users can select pickup and drop locations, ride time, and confirm booking. My Rides: Shows a list of currently scheduled rides with details like date, time, location, and fare in ₹ (Indian Rupees). Completed Trips: Displays past trips in a card or list layout with archived information about each journey. Profile: Allows users to view and manage account details, enable/disable 2FA, change passwords, and manage connected accounts. Add a separate Subscription Plans page that clearly displays different ride plans (monthly, quarterly, yearly) with descriptions, features, and pricing — all using the Indian currency symbol (₹) Add an option for corporate and for college students or college tie ups as well. Highlight benefits like reduced fares, priority booking, and exclusive access to peak-time rides. Focus on localization and customization for Indian users — including styling elements, currency formatting, and cultural preferences (like ride timings, fare displays, and form inputs). All currency values in the UI should use the Indian Rupee (₹) symbol instead of the Dollar ($). This project should reflect a minimal yet complete MVP of a ride-booking web platform tailored for the Indian market with secure authentication, animated interactions, and an elegant, mobile-first UI design.
